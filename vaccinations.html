<p>One major role our veterinary doctors play is to vaccinate your dogs and keep them healthy. The steps are simple just go through our websites fil the form and book an appointment if you cannot visit either of our vet hospitals our doctors will come to you and ensure that your dogs are properly taken care of.
Just as medicine is important to our health as human beings dog vaccinations is key for our dogs. Dogs require their shots to prevent them from canine diseases that can be detrimental to health.</p>
<h2> Vaccine Schedules </h2>
<p> Dogs should be vaccinated as regularly as possible from birth especially as the one given to them at them loses potency faster than that of humans and as such should be vaccinated frequently. These shots should begin as early as six weeks until the dog is about 16weeks old. For diseases like leptospirosis and rabies, dogs require regular check-up and at puppy love, our veterinarian doctors can ensure that these check-ups are met properly.</p>
