			<h3><b> FACTS ABOUT ST BERNARD <b/></h3>
		  <p>Saint Bernards are known to big curly loving dogs, gentle and tolerant in spite of their size. They are family dogs and loved by everyone. Saints are naturally friendly, intelligent and are not easily made aggressive unless it relates to its owners or family members. One important thing to note about this breed is that they are prone to health conditions so to have this dog one should be ready to take care of it and keep it in a clean environment.</p>
