			<h3><b> FACTS ABOUt TIBETAN MASTIFF <b/></h3>
			 <p>From the name has its origins from Tibet. Generally regarded as the most expensive dogs. Originally Mastiffs were used to guard livestock and property, currently, they have become household dogs although some still perform the role of being guard dogs.</p>
			 <p><b>SIZE:</b>Male Mastiff weighs about 100-160 or more pounds; while the female weighs about 75-125 pounds. In terms of height, the male mastiff is 2inch tall, while female mastiff stands </p>
			 <p><b>MAJOR CHARCTERSITICS:</b>.They have really heavy manes and have thick coats. They do not adapt well to living in an apartment although with time and patience they can adjust. Mastiffs are not the appropriate dogs for new dog owners as it will be difficult for them to understand and take care of. Their furriness makes them suitable for cold weather. Also, Mastiff is kid friendly and family friendly as they are loyal and love company. Its size is also something to be watchful of because it has the tendency of becoming obese because of too much consumption of food. And just like every other dog's Mastiff has the potential of mouthiness, everything can be chewed by them. It is important to always have a leash on when walking a mastiff.</p>
			 <p><b>EXERCISE:</b>.Generally, Mastiffs are usually active in the mornings and evening and such it is necessary to have time to exercise them during these times. Mastiffs are high energy dogs with a lot of stamina and are always ready for exercise. But it all depends on the breed one has.</p>
			 <p><b>Life-Span:</b>10-14years</p>
